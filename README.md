# ERC-721D
ERC-721D is a free, open standard for NFT projects to reward their diamond hands.

# THE STANDARD
We have redefined the profit distribution of the NFT project, which is a new standard that can reward diamond hands directly through the smart contract and your official website. If you are a founder, just use our code, it's free and open source.

# All about the trust
The most important thing in the crypto community is the trust between Holders and Founders. We have therefore designed an open mechanism:  75% of the mint earnings + 55% of the royalty earnings are given back to holders

**One more thing**
The founder cannot withdraw the entire funds unless accumulated profits reaches 10,000.00 ETH.
